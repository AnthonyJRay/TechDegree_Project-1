        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring developer of sorts, who is looking to make a career change to something a bit more enjoyable. I have worked in many trades, and construction jobs such as:</p>
        <ul class="jobs_list">
          <li>Roofing</li>
          <li>Remodeling</li>
          <li>Sawmills</li>
          <li>Utilities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I have been at the bottom, and the top, but have never found the interest and enjoyment I am looking for in a career.</p>
        <p> I tried this many years ago when I was younger, but quickly turned away when I realized the level of dedication required. Times have changed, and I grow more and more interested and excited as I learn and my skills develop. </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>In the <em>short term</em>, my goals are just learning the basics, and completing the TechDegree Program at Team Treehouse, which includes:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the <em>long term</em>, i'd like to find employment as a front-end web developer. Sharpening and mastering my skills, while continuing to learn and develop new skills in the process.</p><br>
        <h3>Currently, I'm 2 weeks into this process, with a lifetime to go, but i'm ready, excited, and eager!</h3>
